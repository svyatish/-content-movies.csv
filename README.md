## Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of movies, including information on budgets, revenues, companies, genres, and ratings. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights about the movie industry using Python.

## Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
* Handling missing values and inconsistent data
* Creation of derived columns (e.g., ROI, profit margins)
* Exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics
* Visualization of trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn (bar plots, heatmaps, scatter plots)
* Correlation analysis between budget, revenue, and other features
* Identification of top-performing production companies and genres

## Tools and Libraries

* Python 
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries (e.g., via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis and visualizations

## Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available and sourced from \[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies?resource=download]. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are included in the scripts.

## Results

Visualizations and key findings are presented in the notebook, highlighting:

* The relationship between budget and gross revenue
* Distribution of movies by genre and company
* Trends over time in movie production and performance
